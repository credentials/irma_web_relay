Quick Setup
-----------

 1. Make sure you enabled the NIO connector in your Tomcat server. If you are running it using Eclipse, go to <WORKSPACE>/Servers/Tomcat v6.0 Server at localhost-config/ and edit servers.xml. Find the port 8080 connector line and change it to:

        <Connector connectionTimeout="20000" port="8080" protocol="org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11NioProtocol" redirectPort="8443"/>

   This makes Eclipse unhappy, so go to the Navigator Pane, selects Servers, select the above directory, and hit refresh.
